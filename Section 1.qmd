## Responsible research assessment: Overview

In this first section you will explore:

-   What is research assessment?
-   Why is responsible research assessment important?
-   International collaborations to improve research assessment

### **What is research assessment?**

Research assessment is any process where you are making a judgement on the quality, significance or impact of research conducted by an individual or groups of individuals, or institution.  This could be during recruitment, annual review, promotion or redundancy processes, while reviewing proposals for funders, or during internal REF preparations or REF panels.

### **Why is responsible research assessment important?**

Research metrics, or bibliometrics, are a statistical analysis of aspects of research publications and their characteristics.  They are a prominent feature of our research eco-system including in research assessment processes.  

When used appropriately metrics can provide valuable insights into aspects of research output. Unfortunately, research metrics are often used uncritically or inappropriately which can cause problems for researchers and research.

Many research metrics have become a shorthand for research quality, but they aren't based on the quality of the actual research itself.  They are a feature of who funded the research, or where it was published, or how many other people are researching a topic.  It isn't always clear how these metrics have been calculated or what each metric actually represents to most people.

Relying on research metrics to make decisions about individuals and their research is a risky way to assess them, it isn't fair to the individual, or the work undertaken to produce the research, and can cause us to overlook important or impactful work.  There is evidence that inappropriate use of metrics has influenced our research cultures negatively.

Making sure we engage with the aim of the assessment we are undertaking and draw on a variety of information including peer review and our own judgement, is a route to undertaking responsible research assessment and improving our research cultures.

### **International collaborations to improve research assessment**

There are several international collaborations aiming to improve research assessment and encourage researchers and institutions to reflect on how they use research metrics in these processes.  The University has outlined its approach in its [statement on responsible use of research metrics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-02/Responsible%20Research%20Metrics%20Statement.pdf){target="_blank"} which states our commitment to the principles of DORA, CoARA and the [Leiden Manifesto](<https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a>){target="_blank"}. 

Below are summaries of two key international initiatives Univeristy of Edinburgh is a signatory of: 

[**DORA: Declaration of Research Assessment**](https://sfdora.org/about-dora/){target="_blank"} 

DORA is a set of principles for responsible research assessment that were published in 2012. They are designed to ensure that the quality and impact of research outputs are “measured accurately and evaluated wisely”.

DORA focuses particularly on the use of journal-based metrics. Its key tenet is to “do not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors (JIFs), as surrogate measures of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions”. 

DORA also supports the idea that research should be assessed on its own merits and not influenced by the reputation of the journal in which it has been published. 

[**CoARA: Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment**](https://www.coara.org/){target="_blank"} 

The CoARA initiative was launched in January 2022 and builds on DORA and other initiatives. Its core principle is "that in the assessment of research, researchers and research organisations needs to recognise that diverse outputs, practices and activities contribute to the quality and impact of research. This requires basing assessment primarily on qualitative judgement for which peer review is central, supported by the responsible use of quantitative indicators". 

The University of Edinburgh is a signatory of, and committed to, both DORA and CoARA.
